# siamfc-yolov3-tracker

Clone, and `cd` into the repo/yolov3 directory. The first thing you need to do is to get the weights file
This time around, for v3, authors has supplied a weightsfile only for COCO [here](https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights), and place the weights file into your repo directory. Or, you could just type (if you're on Linux)
```
wget https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights 
```
